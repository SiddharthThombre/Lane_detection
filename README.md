Project Name: Lane Detection in Videos

Project Description: This project implements lane detection in videos using computer vision techniques. It detects lanes on roads captured in videos, providing valuable insights for autonomous driving systems and lane departure warning systems.

Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy

Key Features:
- Real-time lane detection in videos
- Gaussian blur and Canny edge detection for preprocessing
- Region of Interest (ROI) selection to focus on relevant areas
- Hough Transform for line detection
- Visualization of detected lanes overlaid on the original video frames

Installation Instructions:
1. Install OpenCV and NumPy:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
